  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Muscle Maps &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>
  <p>Muscle Maps is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information the app accesses, how it is used, and your rights.</p>
  <h2>Information We Access</h2>
  <p><strong>Location.</strong> The app requests access to your device location while the app is in use. Location data is processed on-device and is never transmitted to our servers or shared with third parties.</p>
  <p><strong>Motion and Fitness.</strong> The app uses your device built-in motion sensor to count steps during gameplay. This data is used solely to track in-game walking progress.</p>
  <p><strong>HealthKit.</strong> With your permission, the app reads your step count from Apple Health to accurately reflect your daily walking activity. The app reads step data only and does not write to HealthKit. HealthKit data is never shared with third parties.</p>
  <p><strong>Camera (AR Mode Only).</strong> The app requests camera access only when you enter AR mode. The camera is used to render AR gameplay overlays (such as nearby zones) in your real-world view. Camera data is processed on-device, is not stored, and is not uploaded to our servers. If you deny camera permission, core non-AR gameplay remains available.</p>
  <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>Muscle Maps does not require account registration. We do not collect your name, email address, or any personally identifiable information. No data is transmitted to external servers. All game data is stored locally on your device.</p>
  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</p>
  <h2>Children Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is rated 4+ and is appropriate for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>All data is stored locally on your device. You can delete all app data at any time by deleting the app from your device.</p>
